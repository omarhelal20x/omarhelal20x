Ever since I was introduced to technology, I became fascinated by how machines can learn, adapt, and solve problems just like humans. That curiosity led me to dive into the field of Artificial Intelligence. I chose this path because I love building things that make a real impact — tools that can think, automate, and improve people’s lives. What drives me most is creating value for others. Whether it’s through smart applications, clean code, or useful insights, I always aim to deliver something that truly helps clients or users. For me, it’s not just about writing code — it’s about solving problems with purpose.
